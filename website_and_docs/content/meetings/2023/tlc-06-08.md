### [Open items](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20new%20owner)

* https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/11526
  * September 30, 2023 was decided as the date we will drop support for Java 8. Java 11 will be the minimum.

### Proposals/Decisions

[List of Needs-Decision Issues](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision)

* Selenium Manager should not remediate issues with drivers on PATH ([#12177](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/12177))
  * It was decided that if a user has a browser driver on their PATH, that is what should prevail.
  * However, this behaviour will change with Selenium 5, where Selenium Manager will be used by default.
    * There will be an environment variable to disable Selenium Manager if needed.
    * An environment variable to disable internet access in Selenium Manager.
    * But if there is an old or incompatible browser driver on the PATH, Selenium Manager will fix that.


### CI Health

* Selenium Manager failing on Windows with Bazel.
* C#  sporadically failing due the changes in the runners.


### [4.11 Milestone](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/milestone/12)
* Announce end of Java 8 support (with the decided)
* Release with CDP v115 
* Including examples, docs & blog(s). 
* Bindings rely on Selenium Manager to check the PATH
* Remote File Download support in Bindings 
* Actions PRs finally(?) (Titus??)

### Selenium 5 Conversation
* Integrate BiDi & CDP interface
* Fully functional Selenium Manager with auto driver & browser downloads
* Split out code to better highlight ecosystem

### Projects in Progress
