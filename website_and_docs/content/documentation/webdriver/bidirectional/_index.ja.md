Selenium is working with browser vendors to create the
[WebDriver BiDirectional Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/)
as a means to provide a stable, cross-browser API that uses the bidirectional
functionality useful for both browser automation generally and testing specifically.
Before now, users seeking this functionality have had to rely on
with all of its frustrations and limitations.

The traditional WebDriver model of strict request/response commands will be supplemented
with the ability to stream events from the user agent to the controlling software via WebSockets,
better matching the evented nature of the browser DOM.

As it is not a good idea to tie your tests to a specific version of any browser, the
Selenium project recommends using WebDriver BiDi wherever possible.

However, until the specification is complete there are many useful things that 
CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) offers. To help keep your tests independent 
and portable, Selenium offers some useful helper classes as well. At the 
moment, they use the CDP, but soon it could be done using WebDriver BiDi.
