    The Selenium project is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy, a 501(c)3 
    non-profit organization. The Conservancy has allowed us to pool organizational 
    resources with other projects, such as Inkscape, Samba, and Wine, in order to reduce 
    the management overhead associated with creating our own, dedicated legal entity.
	</p>
	<p class="lead mb-0">
    The majority of sponsorship funds go directly towards supporting the Selenium project, 
    such as server and software expenses. A small portion of the funds are set aside for 
    the Conservancy to continue their work in supporting Selenium and other open source 
    initiatives.

      <p>
        Our goals are simple: we want to be able to continue improving Selenium -- everything from code reviews to specialized
        bug fixes to paying hosting bills -- for the benefit of the entire Selenium user and the public at large.
        We want sponsors to be able to make tax-deductible donations and for the project to publicly acknowledge
        these donations.

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You (or your company) are contributing to an extraordinary open source project.
          </li>
          <li>
            For corporate donations that equal or are more than the Platinum level, your logo 
            will be placed on our site for one year, as well as on the sponsor wiki pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each six months of non-sponsorship, your logo will be moved to the next lowest 
            sponsorship level on the sponsor wiki page. If your logo is in the Bronze level 
            when this happens it will be removed from the sponsor wiki page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Community consciousness of your company (and its use of Selenium) will be increased 
            in the minds of the wider Selenium community.
          </li>
          <li>
            People find out about Selenium first from our website; having a link from our 
            website therefore will associate you and/or your company as a supporter of the 
            Selenium project that our users love.

            Contributions are tax-deductible.

    <div class="w-lg-75">
      <p>
        The Selenium project will consider the value of non-monetary donations 
        to the project - for example, donations of hardware, software licenses, 
        or hosting - on a case-by-case basis. We will set a sponsorship level 
        appropriately. We note that non-monetary donations may not be tax-deductible; 
        to confirm, you should seek the counsel of a qualified tax professional. 
        In general, we suggest cash donations, as that process is much simpler.

        For larger donations (Gold and higher), we request that payment is remitted by check 
        or wire transfer. This ensures 100% of the donation goes to the project and that we 
        don't pay unnecessarily large transaction fees. To pay by check, make it payable to 
        "Software Freedom Conservancy" and write "Selenium Sponsorship" in the "memo" field.
        Checks should be sent to the following address, so that the Conservancy can process them:
